            <p>I've made a lot of mistakes before I understand what I want: Now I do not draw very specific drafts, for they curb my imagination and enthusiasm.</p>
            <p>I look forward to the day's weather, time, and my mood to go to the studio. When I get there, I lay all the pigments and other media on the ground and choose the one of them by intuition.</p>
            <p>Before I apply the strokes to the canvas, or use any other media, I may have some ideas, vaguely or clearly. However, after I start, all the elements are activated and work on each other, which will always lead to something unexpected. This is exciting, but it may also deviate from my original idea. Then, I may interrupt for a couple of days, contemplating, comparing, until everything filters through.</p>
            <p>The true satisfaction my always elude me. Sometimes, the more I work on it, the less satisfied I am. Sometimes, I find in my work what other people have done, and I do not want to repeat, not to replicate. In the Information Age, repetition and replication seem to be unavoidable. Under such circumstances, we need to rediscover and revive painting.</p>
            <p>In my opinion, art is not aimed at innovation; and even if your theme remains unchanged, you can work out something creative.</p>
